                <h3>What is Kinetic Energy?</h3>
                <p>Kinetic energy is the energy that is produced when an object is in motion.<br>Kinetic energy is measured in joules and the formula is K=0.5mv<sup>2</sup>. (m=mass & v=speed)</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Kinetic Energy for Untamed</h3>
                <p>For most of Untamed you are moving. During that time you have always changing amount of kinetic energy.<br>Inorder to be able to calculate the kinetic energy, we need to get two things. First we need the speed and the weight of the <br> vehicle's weight. From previous calculations, we know the the speed is 44mph at its max and from our sources, we know that <br> the weight of the vehicle is 435kg. We can now use the formula for kinetic energy (K=0.5mv<sup>2</sup>) to get the max kinetic energy <br> for Untamed. Untamed's kinetic energy is:</p>
                <h4>K = 421,080J</h4>
                <br>

                <p>
                    In order to figure out the Kinetic energy, we need to use the formula: K=0.5mv<sup>2</sup>
                    <br>
                    Steps:
                    <br>
                    1. K = 0.5 x 435 x 44<sup>2</sup>
                    <br>
                    2. K = 0.5 x 435 x 1,936
                    <br>
                    3. K = 0.5 x 842,160
                    <br>
                    4. K = 421,080J

                <h3>What is Potential Energy?</h3>
                <p>Potential energy is the energy an object prossesses by virtue of its position in a feild. Two examples of such feilds <br> are gravitational and electrical. The formula for potential energy is P.E.=mxgxh (m=mass in kg, g=gravitational acceleration, <br>h=height)and it is measured in joules (J).</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Potential Energy for Untamed</h3>
                <p>Even though most of the ride is moving, there are some brief moments when the ride stops (or comes close to stopping).<br> One big example of this is when the ride is at the top of the vertial climb right before it goes down at 97 degrees. From collected data, we know <br>that the car's weight is 435kg and that the height is 72ft at that point. So when you put this into the formula, you get the following potential energy:</p>
                <h4>PE = 307,144J</h4>
                <br>

                <p>
                    In order to figure out the Potential energy, we need to use the formula: P.E.=mxgxh
                    <br>
                    Steps:
                    <br>
                    1. PE = 435 x 1 x 72
                    <br>
                    2. PE = 435 x 72
                    <br>
                    3. PE = 307,144J
