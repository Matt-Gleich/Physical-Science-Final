                <h3>What is Kinetic Energy?</h3>
                <p>Kinetic energy is the energy that is produced when an object is in motion.<br>Kinetic energy is measured in joules and the formula is K=0.5mv^2.</p>
                <h3>Kinetic Energy in Untamed</h3>
                <p>For most of Untamed, you are moving. During that time you have always changing amount of kinetic energy.<br>Inorder to be able to calculate the kinetic energy, we need to get two things. First we need the speed and the weight of the <br> vehicle's weight. From previous calculations, we know the the speed is 44mph at its max and from our sources, we know that <br> the weight of the vehicle is 435 kg. We can now use the formula for kinetic energy (K=0.5mv^2) to get the max kinetic energy <br> for Untamed. Untamed's kinetic energy is:</p>
                <h4>K = 18651529800j</h4>
