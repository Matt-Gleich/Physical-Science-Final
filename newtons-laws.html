                <h3>What is Newton's First Law?</h3>
                <p>Newton's first law (the law of interia) is stated as "An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion<br> stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by a unbalanced force".</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Newton's First Law in Untamed</h3>
                <p>Newton's first law is crutial to this roller coasters and most roller coasters that aren't always powered by a motor. In Untamed this law doesn't <br>come into play until after the vertical climb. This is due to the fact that the car is moved <br>up the vertical climb using a motor. Due to the fact that the car is in motion thanks <br>to the motor before it goes down the vertical climb, it stays in <br> motion throughout the rest of the ride. Over time forces such as gravity and friction slow the car down.

            </div>
                <h3>What is Newton's Second Law?</h3>
                <p>Newton's second law is stated as "The acceleration of an object as produced by a net force is directly proportional <br>to the magnitude of the net force, in the same direction as the net force, and inversely proportional to the mass of the object".</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Newton's Second Law in Untamed</h3>
                <p> Even though it might not be a very good example, it still works. The speed of the car going down the track, if affected by the weight of the cart. <br>This means that is there is no one in the car it will go slower than if someone was in the cart. This might not be a problem with the <br>design of this coaster but if the speed wasn't fast enough (due to the car not being heavy enough) than it might not be able to <br>go through the loops, makeing the car stuck in the middle of the ride.

                <h3>What is Newton's Third Law?</h3>
                <p>Newton's third law is stated as "For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction".</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Newton's Third Law in Untamed</h3>
                <p> An example of Newton's third law on Untamed has to do with the seat. A passenger pushes on the <br>seat of the roller coaster and the seat pushes him/her back wiht an equal and opposite force.
