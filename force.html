            <p class="animated once fadeInUp delay-1s">During the course of Untamed, there are two forces acting on the car. The first force is gravity and how it keeping the car on the track and changing the speed of the car when it goes either up or down. Gravity also slows down the car when it is going through loops. The other force is acceleration. When you are riding in a coaster car that is traveling at a constant speed, you only feel the downward force of gravity. But as the car speeds up or slows down, you feel pressed against your seat or the restraining bar.</p>
