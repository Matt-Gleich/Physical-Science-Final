            <p class="animated once fadeInUp">Canobie Lake Park, located in Salem, New Hampshire opened in 1902 for a
            fun stop on a long trolley ride. Over time, the park has worked on refining its
            rides and its general user experience. Even though it had some rough patches,
            Canobie lake park has been a huge source of jobs and revenue for the state of
            New Hampshire.

            Untamed was added to the park on June 11th, 2011. It was the first roller
            coaster added to the park since 1991 when the Dragon Coaster was added. It
            was installed by the Ride Entertainment Group. It is a Gerstlauer Euro-Fighter
            320+ which is a type of coaster known for their vertical lift and beyond vertical
            drop. The rides main attraction is the rides three inversions and the vertical
            lift. At the time of opening and even to this day, it is one of the most extreme
            rides at Canobie.

            As far as the Gerstlauer Euro-Fighter 320+, there are currently 23 in only
            5 in operation around the world. As discussed earlier, their main attraction is
            their vertical lift, beyond vertical lift, and its use of loops. This means that
            untamed was really more themed by the park, not designed.
